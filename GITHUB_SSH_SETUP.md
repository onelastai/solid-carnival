# ðŸ”‘ GitHub SSH Key Setup for OneLastAI

## Step 1: Copy Your Public SSH Key

Your public SSH key is:
```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIHwnK7DcqnAWHC7qnafR12Ymd1AfZpRqyHvrnO7QRL/5 onelatai@github.com
```

## Step 2: Add Key to GitHub

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click your profile picture** (top right) â†’ **Settings**
3. **In the left sidebar**, click **"SSH and GPG keys"**
4. **Click "New SSH key"** or **"Add SSH key"**
5. **Fill in the form**:
   - **Title**: `OneLastAI Codespace - $(date)`
   - **Key**: Paste the public key above
6. **Click "Add SSH key"**
7. **Confirm with your password** if prompted

## Step 3: Test GitHub SSH Connection

After adding the key, we'll test the connection with:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

## Step 4: Update Git Remote to Use SSH

We'll change from HTTPS to SSH authentication:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:1-ManArmy/fluffy-space-garbanzo.git
```

## Step 5: Deploy to Production

Once GitHub SSH is working, we'll deploy all 27 AI agents:
```bash
./deploy-to-ec2.sh
```
